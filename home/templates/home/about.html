            GT Movies Store is a full-stack Django web application that lets users
            explore, search, and purchase movies online.
            The platform includes account registration, secure login, and a shopping cart
            system for managing movie orders.
            Users can also create, edit, and delete reviews to share feedback and help
            others make informed decisions.
            Built with the Django framework and a SQLite database, GT Movies Store delivers a
            responsive, user-friendly interface
            with detailed movie pages that include title, description, price, and images.
            The project demonstrates how Python,
            Djangoâ€™s MVT architecture, and database integration come together
            to create a modern e-commerce experience.
